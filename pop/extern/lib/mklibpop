# --- Revision History ---------------------------------------------------
# --- Joe Wood, Aug 28 2010
#              Make linux use -D_GNU_SOURCE, required for getting register names
# --- Robert Duncan, Nov  3 1998
#		Uses C compiler from $POP__cc, or "cc" as default
# --- Robert Duncan, Aug 11 1998
#		Added case for DG/UX
# --- Julian Clinton, Aug  7 1998
#		Added '-Ae' to HP-UX CC_FLAGS.
# --- John Gibson, Mar 25 1998
#		Added case for AIX
# --- Robert Duncan, Aug  9 1996
#		Added case for NCR SVR4
# --- Robert Duncan, Apr 25 1996
#       Simplified Linux case; now also works for ELF
# --- Robert John Duncan, Mar 23 1995
#       Extended IRIX and SVR4 cases to cover higher version numbers
# --- John Gibson, Mar  8 1995
#       Added OSF1 case
# --- Poplog System, Jan 18 1995 (Julian Clinton)
#       Added Linux and SCO cases.
# --- Robert John Duncan, Nov  2 1994
#       Added -G 0 compilation option for all MIPS systems
# --- Robert John Duncan, May 25 1994
#       More flags for IRIX 5
# --- Robert John Duncan, Mar 21 1994
#       Added case for SG IRIX 5+
# --- John Gibson, Nov 13 1993
#       Rewritten to just create libpop.a
# --- John Gibson, Sep 17 1993
#       Changed "ar" for SunOS 5 to /usr/ccs/bin/ar
# --- Simon Nichols, Aug  9 1993
#       Compiled source files of libXpop.a on MIPS systems with -G 0,
#       because of problems on IRIX resulting from __pop_xt_wakeup_struct
#       being defined in a file compiled -G 0 but referenced in a file not
#       compiled -G 0 (this appears to be a linker bug).
# --- Simon Nichols, Aug  2 1993
#       Removed unnecessary (and erroneous) occurences of ``&& \''
#       resulting from last change
# --- John Gibson, Jul 23 1993
#       Removed creation of .olb symbolic links
# --- Robert John Duncan, Jun  7 1993
#       Added extra case for vanilla SVR4
# --- Robert John Duncan, Jun  2 1993
#       o Changed to create two libraries: libpop.olb & libXpop.olb
#       o Removed dependence on system-type argument: now uses _____uname(1)
#         instead
#       o Separated the work out into disjoint cases, because they're all
#         subtly different
# --- Simon Nichols, May 25 1993
#       o Changed test for Solaris 2
#       o Added -DSVR4 to CFLAGS for Solaris 2
# --- John Gibson, May 12 1993
#       Changed to use POP_X_INCLUDE for include files
#       (now set by $popcom/popenv)
# --- John Gibson, May  6 1993
#       Added -I$XROOT/include to cc commands
# --- Simon Nichols, Jan 29 1993
#       Changed to create both static archive and shared library on HP9000
# --- Robert John Duncan, Aug  7 1992
#       Changed to create both static archive and shared library on SunOS 5
# --- Robert John Duncan, Jul 27 1992
#       Added test for existence of ranlib on Sun 4
# --- Robert John Duncan, Dec  2 1991
#       Added case for SGI IRIS
# --- Robert John Duncan, Jun 12 1991
#       Changed to take system name as argument, to simplify tests
# --- Simon Nichols, May 30 1990
#       1) Changed test option from -x to -f, because Ultrix test(1)
#          does not recognise -x.
#       2) Checked for the existence of /usr/bin/ranlib, again for the
#          benefit of Ultrix.
